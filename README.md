#### FAQ

  * What is Contracts Window +?
    * Contracts Window + is versatile contract display window that allows for contract grouping and sorting, window re-sizing and moving, along with several other abilities.
  * How can I group contracts together into individual lists?
    * The process is described in more detail below; in short, any contracts can be added to as many existing contract mission lists as you want, or you can create a new mission.
	* All mission lists, and their ordering and sorting options, are saved to your persistent file, and will be loaded every time you change scenes or load a new vessel.
  * Something has gone wrong; where can I get help?
    * If there is some kind of error, duplicate or missing contracts, blank window, mission lists deleted, etc... report problems either to the [**GitHub Issues**][CWP:issues] section or the [**KSP Forum Thread**][CWP:release].
	

### The Annotated Window
-------------------------------

#### Header and footer bars
![][CWP:annotated-breakout]

#### Window content
![][CWP:annotated-interior]

#### Top Bar
![][CWP:top-bar]

##### The top bar has several buttons that are used to adjust contract ordering and display options. 
  * The top-left icon opens a new window with options for changing **sort order** based on several criteria.
  * The next icon toggles between **ascending and descending order** for the selected sorting type.
  * The eyeball icon on the right toggles between the **active and hidden contract list**. Each mission list has its own active and hidden contract lists.
  * The top-right icon opens a new **mission selection** window, displaying all of the existing contract missions. 
    * Selecting a mission will switch the primary display to those contracts. 
	* The primary mission is always at the top of the list and contains all contracts.

#### Bottom Bar
![][CWP:bottom-bar]

##### The bottom bar has several buttons that control various window options.
  * The **version number** is displayed on the left.
  * **Tooltips** for most buttons can be toggled on and off with the next icon.
  * The spinning arrows icon is used to **reset the window** and primary contract list. A confirmation box will open upon pushing this button.
    * This should generally not be needed, but if there are errors in the contract window (no contracts displayed, no "MasterMission" contract list, the window is too small, etcâ€¦) this can be used. All window size, font size, and position options will be reset; the internal list of contracts will be updated with all active contracts and the "MasterMission" will be reset with this internal list. All other mission lists *should* be unaffected, these can be manually deleted if there are any other problems.
  * The aA icon controls **font size** for most of the window's labels. Each font is increased by one unit.
  * The next icon toggles the overall **window and texture element size**. It also increases the font size by two units.
    * Between the font and window size options there are four available font sizes and two window element size options.

#### Contract Title Bar
![][CWP:title-bar]

##### Each contract has a title bar above it with information and options for the contract. 
  * The **contract difficulty**, or prestige, is displayed on the left with one to three stars.
  * The **time remaining** for the contract is shown next. It updates every five seconds (at high time-warp several days can go by during this period) and switches to days and hours, and turns yellow, when the counter gets low. The year/day time is dependent on your selection of Earth/Kerbin days in the KSP settings menu.
  * The A icon can be used to display the **flag and agency name** for the contract.
  * The eyeball icon can be used to move the contract into the **hidden or active contract list**.
  * The pin icon can be used to **pin the contract** to the top of the list.
    * Pinned order ignores sort and order type.
    * A contract's pinned state is persistent.
  * The checkbox icon can be used to move the contract into a different **contract mission list** or create a new one; this can be used from any mission list.
  * The blue icon at the end can be used to **display contract notes** if they exist.
    * These are different from individual parameter notes.

#### Contract and Parameter Titles
![][CWP:contract-param-title]

##### The primary contract and parameter display generally shows the same information as the stock contract window.
  * In orange is the **contract title**. It is a button that can be pushed to collapse or expand the contract's parameters.
    * When completed the contract text will turn green; when failed it will turn red.
  * The **contract parameters** are shown in white.
    * When completed these will turn green.
  * **Contract parameter notes** can be displayed using the blue icon.
  * **Sub-parameters** are offset slightly and are shown in a darker color.
    * When all sub-parameters are completed they will be collapsed into their parent parameter and no longer be displayed.

#### Contract and Parameter Rewards
![][CWP:rewards]

##### The rewards for each contract and their parameters are displayed on the right side of the window. 
  * **Funds, Rep, and Science rewards** are displayed depending on how wide the window is.
    * Rewards are in green, penalties are in red.
  * The amount of any reward/penalty due to **strategies**, if any, is displayed in parenthesis.

#### Mission Creator Window
![][CWP:mission-creator]

##### When the green checkbox icon is selected the mission list will appear. 
  * The current **contract mission lists** are displayed.
    * A green checkmark indicator on the left indicates that the currently selected contract is already in that mission
    * The green number to the right is the **amount of contracts** in that list.
	* The red x box on the right can be used to remove a contract from any mission that it is present in.
  * Selecting any **existing mission** will add the contract to it.
  * Selecting the **Create New Mission** option will open the mission creator window.
  * **New missions** can be created after giving them a name.
    * Missions must have a name, can't use the same name, and must be under 20 characters.

#### Mission Title Bar
![][CWP:mission-title]

##### The mission title bar is shown at the top of the window; it can be used to **edit any mission** except the "MasterMission".

##### Mission Edit Window
![][CWP:mission-edit]

  * **Change the name** or **delete any mission** from within this window.
